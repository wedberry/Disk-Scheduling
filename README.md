Authors: Edward Berry, Bella Hessler

This project was assigned in CMS 470: Operating Systems

The goal of this project was to demonstrate an undersanding of disk scheduling algorithms including the pros and cons of different algorithms. 

Sample command to invoke the program:
  cc -o main main.c -Wall -Werror
   ./main 10
   ./main 10 -r

   The command line arguments include the number of requests to generate and the option to make output nondeterministic using the -r flag
